# Dotfiles

Do you use neovim every day, but only touch the config once every six months and thus completely forget how to do _anything_ until something inevitably breaks and ruins your day and you go "man I wish I had just put this in a repo" but you don't have time to fix that now so you spend the rest of the week trying to remember how to write code without vim commands and you feel sad every time you press a key? Yeah, me too.

A personal repository to hold various shared configurations.

Also a perpetual WIP ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
